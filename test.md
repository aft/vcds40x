In computing, communication between digital and analogue (and/or digital) is done using input/output or I/O (also known as IO). Inputs are the data received by the computer, and outputs are the data sent to the outside world or to an another computer.

We, as humans, interact with a computer using I/O devices like custom user interfaces, a keyboard, a mouse or a screen. We take advantages of devices that communicate with other devices such as wireless modems, network cards and GPS. With the advancement of mobile technologies, we have new input options like a touch screen, a gyroscope, a camera etc. for the devices we have in our pockets.

A computer takes any or combination of these sensory data, processes them and returns a predictable output.
